The Decentralised File System (dfs) is a file system built for the ![FairOS](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairOS/blob/master/README.md).
It is a stateless thin layer which uses the building blocks provided by Swarm to provide high level functionalities like
- Exposing a logical file system
- Creation of logical drives
- User and Permission management
- Charging and Payments
- Mutable, Indexed data structures over immutable file system

dfs can be used for the following use cases
1) Personal data store
2) Application data store (for both Web 3.0 DApps and web 2.0 Apps)
3) Data sharing with single user and on an organizational level

### User
The first step in dfs is to create a user. Every user is associated with a 12 
word mnemonic based hd wallet. This wallet is password protected and stored in 
the datadir. whenever a user created a pod for himself, a new key pair is created 
using this mnemonic. A user can use this mnemonic and import their account in any 
device and instantly see all their pods.

### What is a pod?
A pod is a personal drive created by a user in fairOS-dfs. It is used to store files and related metadata in a decentralised fashion. A pod is always under the control of the user who created it. A user can create and store any number of files or directories in a pod. 
The user can share files in his pod with any other user just like in other centralised drives like dropbox. Not only users, a pod can be used by decentralised applications (DApp's) to store data related to that user.

Pod creation is cheap. A user can create multiple pods and use it to organise his data. for ex: Personal-Pod, Applications-Pod etc.

### How to build and run dfs?
- git clone https://github.com/fairdatasociety/fairOS-dfs.git
- cd fairOS-dfs
- make binary
- ./dist/dfs prompt (starts dfs in REPL mode)
- ./dist/dfs server (starts dfs in server mode serving API in port 9090 by default)
